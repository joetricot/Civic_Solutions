# Civic_Solutions

A focal point of a well run civic community is its ability to respond to constituent requests in a timely and effective manner. However, those very same constituents aren't able to relay and prioritize their concerns to city hall.

311 tools in NYC are not user friendly and users cannot access a history of complaints made in a personal portal - rather they must dig into their email to locate a long confirmation number and input that. In addition, local neighborhood organizations, which are well equipped to tackle civic issues,  are not automatically kept in the loop whenever a request is made.

Civic Solutions is a crowd sourced based, collaborative platform that leverages local neighborhood organizations, such as BIDs (business improvement districts), in order to report and manage neighborhood complaints through an effective public-private partnership.

Users can initiate requests through the app which then gets relayed to 311 and the local BID/civic organization. Users can also see a list of current complaints in their district, including resolution status, and make a comment or endorse the complaint.

## User Stories
As a resident, shopkeeper, or community member, I'd like a seamless, intuitive way to examine or report civic issues for quick resolutions.

As an elected official for this district, I'd like my office and partnership organization to be held more accountable for resolving constituent issues quickly.

As a BID or neighborhood organization, we'd like to stay on top of neighborhood concerns which helps us better understand the community's needs and helps us address them with city hall and the concerned party.
